crypto wallet&amp; MVVM with SWIFT

It's my test project in SWIFT IOS. Here you can see crypto wallet, who get 20 cryptomonet from API. When u click on any cell in TableView you will push another viewController with info about every monet.

i used in this project:
1) MVVM
2) User defaults to save state of login screen. ( if u logged ones in 1 seesion, u have not log in again if u close this app or have in in background )
3) URLSession to get info from API
